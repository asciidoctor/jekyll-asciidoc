= Classifying Your Post

In Jekyll, you classify a post by assigning it to categories and/or tags.
We recommend defining these with the Asciidoc page attributes `page-categories` and `page-tags`, but it is also possible to define them in the front matter with the Jekyll page variables `categories` and `tags`.

The attribute value must be expressed using the inline Array syntax for YAML: a comma-separated list of items surrounded by square brackets.
If you only have one item, you can omit the brackets.
In this case, you can also drop the plural from the attribute name.
