= Using AsciiDoc attributes in a Liquid template

Let's say you want to reuse your AsciiDoc attributes in a Liquid template.
This section describes how to do it.

Liquid can only access simple data structures, not complex ones like the one used to store site-wide AsciiDoc attributes. (Site-wide AsciiDoc attributes are stored deep within the Jekyll configuration data as a Hash with symbol keys).
This puts them out of the reach of Liquid templates by default.

This plugin must store site-wide AsciiDoc attributes in this way due to how Jekyll is implemented and the lifecycle it exposes for plugins.
That part can't be changed.
The plugin is limited by Jekyll's design.
However, YAML provides a mechanism that we can leverage to expose these attributes to our Liquid templates.

First, you define your AsciiDoc attributes at the top level of your configuration file where Liquid is able to access them.
If you also assign a YAML reference to this key, you can then pass that Hash to the attributes key in the asciidoctor block, thus allowing the configuration to be shared.

[source,yaml]
----
asciidoc_attributes: &asciidoc_attributes
  imagesdir=/images
asciidoctor:
  attributes: *asciidoc_attributes
  ...
----

You can now reference one of the site-wide AsciiDoc attributes in the Liquid template as follows:

----
{{ site.asciidoc_attributes.imagesdir }}
----

Keep in mind that the value of the attribute will be unmodified from the value defined in the configuration file.
