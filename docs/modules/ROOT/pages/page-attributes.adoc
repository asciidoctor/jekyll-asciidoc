= Page Attributes

Any AsciiDoc attribute defined in the AsciiDoc document header whose name begins with `page-` (<<customizing-the-page-prefix, cf this>>) gets promoted to a {url-jekyll-variables}[page variable].
The part of the name after the `page-` prefix is _lowercased_ and used as the variable name (e.g., page-LayOut becomes layout).
The variable value is the {url-yaml}[YAML] data (single-line form) translation of the attribute string value.

Since the Asciidoc string attribute value is processed into YAML data as a page variable, you can build nested data structure using the inline YAML syntax.
For example, here's how you can assign a value to the `page.header.image` page variable:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-header: { image: logo.png }
----

To define a page attribute name that contains multiple words, use either a hyphen or underscore character to connect the words.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-short-name: slug
----

IMPORTANT: Page attributes must be defined in the document header.
That means either putting them directly below the document title (the line beginning with a single equals sign in the sample above) or above all other AsciiDoc content if the document title is not defined in AsciiDoc.
The AsciiDoc document header ends at the first blank line.
For more details about the document header, see the xref:asciidoc:document:header.adoc[] documentation.

IMPORTANT: You may use include directives in the the document header.
Note that the document header will end before any blank line included.

NOTE: If a page attribute (e.g. `page-quality`) is defined in the document header and the corresponding page variable (e.g. `quality`) is defined in the document front matter, the page attribute overides the page variable.

CAUTION: If a `'page-'` attribute defined in the header of an AsciiDoc document is not visible to another plugin or Liquid template, you may have a plugin ordering problem.
See the xref:installation.adoc#plugin-ordering[discussion here] to learn how to fix it.

== Customizing the `page-` prefix

The prefix identifying the attributes mapped to Jekyll page variables may be set with the asciidoc key `page_attribute_prefix` in _config.yml.
For example,

[source,yml]
----
asciidoc:
  page_attribute_prefix: ji # for "jekyll integration"
----

Now

[source,adoc]
----
= My Fabulous Page
:ji-quality: infinite

Yes, it's fabulous!
----

will result in the page variable `quality` with value `infinite`.
A hyphen is automatically added to the value of this configuration setting if the value is non-empty (e.g, `jekyll` becomes `jekyll-`).
