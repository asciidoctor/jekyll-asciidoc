= Page Attributes

Any AsciiDoc attribute defined in the AsciiDoc document header whose name begins with ``page-``footnote:[The prefix used to label page attributes can be customized.] gets promoted to a {url-variables}[page variables].
The part of the name after the `page-` prefix is _lowercased_ and used as the variable name (e.g., page-layout becomes layout).
The value is processed as {url-yaml}[YAML] data (single-line form).

Since the attribute value is processed as YAML data, you can build nested data structure using the inline YAML syntax.
For example, here's how you can assign a value to the `page.header.image` page variable:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-header: { image: logo.png }
----

To define a page attribute that contains multiple words, use either a hyphen or underscore character to connect the words.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:page-short-name: slug
----

IMPORTANT: Page attributes must be defined in the document header.
That means either putting them directly below the document title (the line beginning with a single equals sign in the sample above) or above all other AsciiDoc content if the document title is not defined in AsciiDoc.
The AsciiDoc document header stops after the first blank line.
For more details about the document header, see the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#doc-header[Document Header] chapter in the Asciidoctor User Manual.

IMPORTANT: You may use include directives in the the document header.
However, you must ensure that the file included _does not_ contain blank lines.

CAUTION: If an attribute defined in the header of an AsciiDoc document is not visible to another plugin or Liquid template, you may have a plugin ordering problem.
See the xref:installation.adoc#plugin-ordering[discussion here] to learn how to fix it.
