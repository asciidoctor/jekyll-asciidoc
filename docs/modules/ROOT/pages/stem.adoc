= Enabling STEM Support

Thanks to Asciidoctor, Jekyll AsciiDoc provides built-in support for processing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) equations in your AsciiDoc documents.
To enable this support, you just need to do a bit of configuration.

== Activating the STEM processing

The first thing you need to do is activate the STEM processing integration in the processor itself.
To do that, set the `stem` attribute on the document.
One way is to set the `stem` attribute in the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Page Title
:stem:
----

Alternatively, you can enable it the `stem` attribute globally for all AsciiDoc documents in your site by adding the following to your site's `_config.yml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
asciidoctor:
  attributes:
  - stem
----

To learn more about the built-in STEM integration, see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#activating-stem-support[STEM] chapter in the Asciidoctor User Manual.

== Adding the STEM assets to the page

Technically, Asciidoctor only prepares the STEM equations for interpretation by https://mathjax.org[MathJax].
That means you have to load MathJax on any page that contains STEM equations (or all pages, if that's easier).
To do so requires some customization of the page layout.

First, create the file [.path]__includes/mathjax.html_ and populate it with the following contents:

[source,html]
----
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
  messageStyle: "none",
  tex2jax: {
    inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
    displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
    ignoreClass: "nostem|nolatexmath"
  },
  asciimath2jax: {
    delimiters: [["\\$", "\\$"]],
    ignoreClass: "nostem|noasciimath"
  },
  TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "none" } }
});
</script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_HTMLorMML"></script>
----

Then, include this file before the closing `</body>` tag in your page layout.

----
{% include mathjax.html %}
----

With that configuration in place, the STEM equations in your AsciiDoc file will be presented beautifully using MathJax.
