= Publishing a Draft Post

You can defer adding a date to a post until it's ready to publish by making it a draft.
To make a draft post, just place it in the [.path]_{empty}_drafts_ folder instead of the [.path]_posts_ folder.
But don't include the date in the filename or AsciiDoc header.

To include the drafts when building the site, pass the `--drafts` flag to the `jekyll` command:

 $ jekyll build --drafts

The date of each draft post will be based on the file's last modification time.

When you're ready to publish the post, move the file from the [.path]_{empty}_drafts_ folder to the [.path]_posts_ folder and assign a date to it either by adding it to the filename or by defining the `revdate` attribute in the AsciiDoc header.
