= Implicit Page Variables

In addition to page attributes defined explicitly (e.g., layout, permalink, etc), the following implicit AsciiDoc attributes are also promoted to page variables:

* doctitle (aka the document title) (becomes `title`)
* id (becomes `docid`)
* author
* revdate (becomes `date`; value is converted to a DateTime object; not applied to pages)

Although not an implicit page variable, another very common page variable to set is `page-description`, which becomes `description` in the model.
