= Implicit Page Variables

In addition to page attributes defined explicitly (e.g., `page-layout`, `page-permalink`, etc), the following implicit AsciiDoc attributes are also promoted to page variables:

[cols='1,1a',opts=header]
|===
| AsciiDoc intrinsic attribute
| Jekyll page variable

| doctitle (aka the document title)
| title

| id
| docid

| author
| author

| revdate
| date

* Value is converted to a DateTime object
* Applied only to documents in a collection such as `_posts`
|===

Although not an implicit page attribute, another very common page attribute to set is `page-description`, which becomes `description` in the Jekyll page model.
