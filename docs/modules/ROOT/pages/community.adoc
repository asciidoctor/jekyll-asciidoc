= Getting Help

The Jekyll AsciiDoc plugin is developed to help you publish your content quickly and easily.
But we can't achieve that goal without your input.
Your questions and feedback help steer the project, so speak up!
Activity drives progress.

When seeking answers, always start with the official documentation for Jekyll, which can be found on the {url-jekyll}[Jekyll website].
If you have general questions about Jekyll, we recommend you visit the {url-jekyll-discuss}[Jekyll Talk] forum to get assistance.
For questions related to this extension specifically, or general questions about AsciiDoc, please post to the {url-asciidoctor-discuss}[Asciidoctor discussion list].
You can also join us in the {url-chat}[asciidoctor/asciidoctor channel] on Gitter.
