* The AsciiDoc document title overrides the title set in the front matter or the auto-generated title (in the case of a post) (#48)
* The AsciiDoc page-related attributes override the matching entries in the page data (i.e., front matter)
* The value of page-related attributes are treated as YAML values (automatic type coercion)
* `page-` is the default prefix for page-related AsciiDoc attributes (e.g., `page-layout`) (#51)
